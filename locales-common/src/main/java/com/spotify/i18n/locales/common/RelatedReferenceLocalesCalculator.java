/**
 * Represents an engine that enables reference locales based operations, most notably to join
 * datasets, based on an origin source supported locale, and a target locale to match.
 *
 * <p>We define a reference locale as a unique and standard locale based on which join operations
 * between datasets are safe to perform. This is required as different locales (or language tags)
 * might actually point to the same language, but have very different identifiers.
 *
 * <p>As an example: we would like to join dataset A and B based on a given language identifier.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Dataset A contains an entry with the language identifier zh-HK.
 *   <li>Dataset B contains an entry with the identifier zh-Hant.
 *   <li>A direct join operation is not possible, as the identifiers differ.
 *   <li>We solve this problem by introducing an intermediary reference locale, which enables both
 *       datasets to be joined.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This join operation must be a 3-step one:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Calculate all related reference locales for a given supported locale (ex: supported user
 *       language). This is done using the {@link
 *       #getRelatedReferenceLocalesForSupportedLocale(String)} method.
 *   <li>Calculate the best matching reference locale for a given target locale (ex: target content
 *       language). This is done using the {@link
 *       #getBestMatchingReferenceLocaleForTargetLocale(String)}
 *   <li>Join datasets based on calculated reference locale only ({@link
 *       RelatedReferenceLocale#referenceLocale()} and output of {@link
 *       #getBestMatchingReferenceLocaleForTargetLocale(String)}), and filter based on the
 *       calculated {@link RelatedReferenceLocale#affinity()}.
 * </ul>
