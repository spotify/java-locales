/**
 * Represents an engine that enables reference locales based operations, most notably to join
 * datasets by enabling match operations between an origin and a target locale, and enabling
 * filtering on the affinity between these locales.
 *
 * <p>Reference locales are unique and standard locales based on which join operations between
 * datasets are safe to perform. This is required as different locales (or language tags) might
 * actually reference the same language, while having very different identifiers.
 *
 * <p>As an example: we would like to join dataset A and B based on language identifiers.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Dataset A contains an entry with the language identifier zh-HK.
 *   <li>Dataset B contains an entry with the identifier zh-Hant.
 *   <li>A direct join operation is not possible, as the identifiers differ.
 *   <li>We solve this problem by introducing an intermediary reference locale, which enables both
 *       datasets to be joined.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This join operation must be a 3-step one:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Calculate all related reference locales for a given origin locale (ex: user language
 *       identifier). This is done using the {@link #calculateRelatedReferenceLocales(String)}
 *       method.
 *   <li>Calculate the best matching reference locale for a given target locale (ex: content
 *       language identifier). This is done using the {@link
 *       #calculateBestMatchingReferenceLocale(String)} method.
 *   <li>Join datasets based on the calculated reference locale ({@link
 *       RelatedReferenceLocale#referenceLocale()} and the output of {@link
 *       #calculateBestMatchingReferenceLocale(String)}), and filter based on the desired level of
 *       {@link RelatedReferenceLocale#affinity()}.
 * </ul>
